//! to support priority levels proved to be impractical -- and many properties have changed since.
//!
//! See the [`OrderedPool`] documentation for details.
//!
//! # Terminology
//!
//! The ordering imposed on the cache entries is determined by a priority (see [`PriorityLevel`]).
//! Throughout the documentation, "high" and "low" indicate priorities, whereas "small" and "large"
//! indicate numeric values (including of priorities, where "high" corresponds to "small" and "low"
//! to "large").

/// # Usage
///
/// ```
/// use coapcore::oluru::{OrderedPool, PriorityLevel};
///
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// struct MyValue {
///     id: u32,
///     name: Option<&'static str>,
/// }
///
/// impl PriorityLevel for MyValue {
///     fn level(&self) -> usize {
///         if self.name.is_some() {
///             0
///         } else {
///             1
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// // A cache with a capacity of three.
/// type MyCache = OrderedPool<MyValue, 3, 2>;
///
/// // Create an empty cache, then insert some items.
/// let mut cache = MyCache::new();
/// cache.insert(MyValue { id: 1, name: Some("Mercury") });
/// cache.insert(MyValue { id: 2, name: Some("Venus") });
/// cache.insert(MyValue { id: 3, name: None });
///
/// let item = cache.lookup(|x| x.id == 1, |x| format!("Found {}", x.name.unwrap_or("unnamed object")));
/// assert_eq!(item.unwrap().as_str(), "Found Mercury");
///
/// // If the cache is full, inserting a new item evicts one item.
/// //
/// // While Venus (ID 2) was used least recently, it has higher priority than the no-name planet
/// // with index 3, so that gets evicted first instead.
/// let returned = cache.insert(MyValue { id: 4, name: Some("Mars") });
/// assert!(returned.expect("Pool was full").is_some_and(|item| item.id == 3));
/// ```
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// Right now, this is implemented as a separate entry vector and an index vector, where the latter
/// is often rotated internally. Future changes may change this to only be a single list, using a
/// doubly linked list, and keeping head indices of each level (which is why the number of levels
/// `L` is part of the type).
///
/// The value list following the style of a `Vec` means that popping elements from anywhere but the
/// tail is costly, which it should better not be; a slab allocator style would improve that.
///
/// ## Terminology
///
/// A "position" is a key to `.sorted`. An "index" is a key to `.entries` (and thus a value of
/// `.sorted`).
///
/// ## Invariants
///
/// Before and after any public function, these hold:
///
/// * `.sorted` has the same length as `.entries`
/// * `.sorted` is a permutation of `.entries`' (and thus its) index space. Therefore, each of its
///   values is unique, and is an index into `.entries`.
/// * If `T::level` is constant, `self.sorted.iter().map(|i| self.entries[i].level())` is sorted.
